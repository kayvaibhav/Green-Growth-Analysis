# Analyzing the Impact of Renewable Energy Investments on Economic Growth and Emission Reduction Across Indian States 
## Background & Context 
India has positioned itself as one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets globally, driven by its commitment to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2070 (IEA, 2023).  
As of mid-2025, renewable and other non-fossil sources account for nearly 49% of India’s installed power capacity, up from just 31% in 2015 (Power Technology, 2025). 
Through flagship initiatives such as the National Solar Mission, Green Hydrogen Mission, and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for solar manufacturing, India aims to reach 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 (Enerdata, 2025; PIB, 2025). 
However, despite the surge in renewable energy deployment, it remains unclear whether these investments translate into measurable economic and environmental outcomes at the state level. 
While macroeconomic data indicates that clean energy infrastructure generates employment and supports industrialization, there is limited state-wise empirical evidence connecting renewable energy capacity growth to Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) or CO₂ emission intensity. 
This gap between investment and measurable outcomes presents a critical managerial and policy challenge: governments and investors must determine whether renewable investments 
are producing proportionate economic returns and emission reductions. 
Hence, this study will quantitatively analyze whether renewable energy capacity growth across Indian states correlates with economic performance (GSDP growth) and environmental 
performance (emission intensity) over the past decade to identify which states are achieving “green growth” and what differentiates them from others.

# Problem Statement 
Despite massive renewable energy investments, there is limited empirical evidence on whether these initiatives yield tangible economic growth and environmental benefits at the state level. Policymakers, investors, and sustainability leaders need data-backed insights to determine which states’ renewable strategies are delivering optimal results — and why others are lagging behind. This study seeks to address the problem by analyzing the relationship between renewable energy capacity expansion and key economic and environmental indicators using publicly available datasets. 
# Objective 
To examine and quantify the impact of renewable energy capacity growth on: 
1. Economic performance — measured by state-level GDP growth, and
2. Environmental performance — measured by CO₂ emissions intensity (CO₂ per unit of 
GDP). 
The goal is to identify whether renewable energy expansion contributes to a “green growth” 
pattern across Indian states and to derive managerial insights for better policy and investment 
decisions.
